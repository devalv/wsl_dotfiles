# Aleksei Devyatkin`s dotfiles

This is a repo for my Ubuntu linux dotfiles. 
Bootstrap is based on the awesome [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

## Installation

**Terminator** and **Fish** shell are bootstrapped automatically in case you 
have them not installed. **Snap** already should be on a host system.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/devalv/wsl_dotfiles .dotfiles && cd .dotfiles && ./install
```

## Notes

### Shell & plugins
The shell is [Fish](https://fishshell.com/). 
Plugins management is powered by [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-osx).

### Editors
The default console editor is **vim**.

### Python
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with **3.10.2** as global default
* [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/)
* [pretty-errors](https://github.com/onelivesleft/PrettyErrors/)
* [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
